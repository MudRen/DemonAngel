// grid_server.c
// The virtual room server for TMI-2. The virtual room concept was implemented
// into the MudOS driver and mudlib by Whiplash@TMI and Truilkan@TMI (and
// possibly several others). This room is a rather direct copy of Truilkan's
// example ocean room. Two main differences are: 1) it is two-dimensional
// rather than three and 2) It has an attached terrain map which controls
// the room descriptions, causing it to have only finite size but more
// interesting rooms. These two differences were implemented by Mobydick@TMI
// in July 1992.
// In August 1992 an exits map was added by Mobydick@TMI which permits
// virtual rooms to have less than the normal four exits.
